                        The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBrj2395i7Q" target="_blank">Joker</a> is Batman's main arch-nemesis, this completely insane character is one of the most popular villains today. Despite being a fan favorite of comics, the origin of the Joker is surrounded by many mysteries and details that the average fan of the character is unaware of.
                        Well, at first not everyone was like this character. In fact, the first time its author, Jerry Robinson, presented the Joker concept art, they were rejected. At the time, executives at DC Comics thought it made no sense to have a clown-faced villain.
                        The Joker appeared in the comics without any sort of explanation or origin story. His debut was in <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(revista_em_quadrinhos)" target="_blank">Batman #1</a>, and the character was presented only as a villain.To this day, <a href="https://www.dc.com/" target="_blank">DC Comics</a> has not made any official story about the "birth" of the Joker official, with his entire past unknown and the identity of the man behind the clown smile remaining a great mystery.
                        In the comic "The Killing Joke", where the Joker is the main character, there was an attempt to give an origin story to the Clown of Crime. Here, Joker is portrayed as a former employee at a chemical plant, who decided to quit to pursue a career as a comedian.
                        The criminals, however, manage to convince him to go ahead with the coup. During the heist, things don't go well and Batman appears to capture the criminals. It is at this moment that the future Joker messes up and ends up falling into a well of chemicals. Her hair turns green and her skin white, like a porcelain doll.
                        The Joker is a controversial character and all because his insanity knows no bounds. He is capable of anything and doesn't need any reason for it!.
Four of the most popular events involving the Joker are linked to four very popular characters from DC Comics. The Clown Prince of Crime was responsible for the <a href="https://www.fatosdesconhecidos.com.br/5-crimes-repulsivos-do-coringa/" target="_blank">death of Jason Todd</a>, the second Robin, murdering him in an extremely violent way.

Then followed Sarah Essen Gordon (the second wife of police officer <a href="https://batman.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/James_Gordon" target="_blank">Jim Gordon</a>) and Barbara Gordon (Batgirl), however the latter ended up surviving by becoming a paraplegic, thus having to abandon her career as Batgirl, later becoming the Oracle.

His insanity culminated in his attack on Superman. After kidnapping Louis Lane, he poisoned the Man of Steel with a mixture of Kryptonite and Scarecrow's Fear Gas. Clark began to hallucinate and when he looked at Louis he didn't see her, but the villain Apocalypse. This caused Superman to end up unwittingly murdering Louis Lane, something that drove Clark insane.
But what is the effect of these attitudes? What is the Joker's true purpose? Before Batman crossed paths with the Joker, he thought that all criminals were the same, that they were only looking for money and that there was a logical sequence to everything.

Upon meeting the Clown of Crime, he realizes that he must not underestimate his enemies and that his strong side can quickly become the weakest. Batman becomes wiser and wiser thanks to the Joker.

After the Joker, Batman realizes he has the ability to make the choices that no one else can, he becomes the Dark Knight, thanks to the Joker.

The Joker isn't a great villain because he has an iconic laugh, or because of his looks. He is excellent because he has a profound effect on the story and the protagonist, he is the perfect antagonist for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htfkBjzUyDE" target="_blank">Dark Knight</a>.
